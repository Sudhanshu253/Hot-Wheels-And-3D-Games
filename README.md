# Hot Wheels And 3D Games

A design-focused project aimed at developing realistic and structurally sound 3D car models using Fusion 360, with hands-on prototyping through 3D printing. This initiative was part of Descon at IIT Kanpur and emphasized design aesthetics, mechanical accuracy, and fabrication skills.

## Project Highlights

- Gained proficiency in **Fusion 360**, focusing on component geometry, surface modeling, and structural design for miniature vehicles.
- Utilized **form modeling** and **joint assemblies** to create detailed, realistic car bodies with attention to lighting, textures, and appearance.
- Exported and processed 3D designs into **precise G-code**, enabling accurate fabrication of prototypes using 3D printing technologies.
- Explored aspects of **automotive design**, including body dynamics, symmetry, and mechanical constraints relevant to toy-scale production.

## Tools & Techniques

- Fusion 360 (solid and form modeling, joint assemblies)
- 3D printing (slicer software, G-code generation, PLA/ABS printing)
- Material design and visual rendering (surface appearance, lighting setup)

## Purpose

This project showcases the intersection of **aesthetic automotive design** and **functional prototyping**, encouraging creat
